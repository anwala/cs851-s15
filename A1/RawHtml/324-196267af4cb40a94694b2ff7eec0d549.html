To fix the morale crisis generals need to stop acting like politicians.</div><section class="content-body article-body-content"><p>Through a decade-plus of war, America’s military men and women, and the families that support them, have experienced their share of hardships. Separations through multiple deployments and the inherent dangers of combat are enough to press the emotional and physical limits of even the strongest individuals.</p><p>For some of these faithful defenders of America’s interests, there have been difficulties far beyond the battlefield—difficulties not imposed by any enemy or the distance and time that separates them from their loved ones. Most ironically, the assault against them—intended or not—can sometimes come from within the military institution for which they fought, bled and sacrificed so much.</p><p>It’s no wonder why there’s concern for morale in today’s force. Just recently, outgoing Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said he too is worried about the decline in enthusiasm, and he believes it will take some time to reversing the mindset and perspective of the force.</p><p>There’s no single reason for the decline in morale, although some reasons are more pronounced than others. Take for instance <a href="http://www.militarytimes.com/longform/military/2014/12/07/americas-military-a-force-adrift/18596571/?sf34440316=1" target="_blank">the question</a> about whether “senior military has my best interests at heart.” In 2009, 53 percent of respondents answered yes. By 2014, only 27 percent answered affirmatively.</p><p>One recurring complaint involves what many service personnel perceive as the excessive politicization of the military during wartime, giving rise to high profile prosecutions, excessive punitive actions and decision making that is at odds with the best interests of service personnel. So much so, instincts necessary in combat have been replaced with second-guessing and hesitation, matched by a growing sense of distrust among the ranks.</p><p>The examples are plentiful. So too are the excuses—often given in defense of ambiguous and restrictive rules of engagement—that seem to ignore the realities of war or the fact that in combat, split-second decisions must be made for the purpose of preserving lives and attaining objectives.</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="centerer"><div class="safe-area"><div class="content">Swenson’s experience was so bad the Army had to alter its process for Medal of Honor nominations and the Secretary of Defense issued him a direct apology.</div></div></div></blockquote><p>In one case, a Special Forces soldier, <a href="http://projects.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=52976" target="_blank">Major Matt Golsteyn</a>, was investigated by the Army for more than a year and a half under the suspicion that he violated the rules of engagement and illegally killed a known enemy fighter and bomb maker in Afghanistan. The allegation was presented through informal channels to the Army, which went to extraordinary lengths to investigate Golsteyn. The Army tried to turn up anything it could, but was unable to find one piece of evidence to corroborate the allegation.</p><p>Today, Golsteyn is still waiting for the Army to make a determination about his future. He’s been sidelined, his Special Forces recognition stripped, all while a guessing-game has ensued about what will happen to this decorated warfighter. Even the men who served under Golsteyn have been threatened at times, with the Army going as far to promise them full immunity several times over. None of them had anything to say.</p><p>If that wasn’t enough, the combat valor awards that Golsteyn received for heroism— including a Silver Star and Distinguished Service Cross—were recently revoked by the Secretary of the Army, John McHugh. It’s McHugh’s belief that if the nominating and approving authorities were aware of allegation, Golsteyn would never have been awarded two of the Army’s highest awards for valor.</p><p>How unfortunate. The career of a decorated soldier and everything he has accomplished over a nearly fifteen-year service career has been taken away. The reason: an allegation that the Army was never able to substantiate.</p><p>That’s no way to treat one of America’s top soldiers.</p><p>There is also <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.armytimes.com%2Fstory%2Fmilitary%2Fcrime%2F2015%2F01%2F12%2Fclint-lorance-afghanistan-murders-case-army%2F21470289%2F&amp;ei=Q7rOVPSBNrLksAS6kID4CQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHP_uxZFMt7vBpyB6wCmQHFdcuK4g&amp;sig2=P6mJLbOrcy43TGLxWViMIw&amp;bvm=bv.85076809,d.cWc" target="_blank">Clint Lorance</a>, who is serving 19 years in military custody for giving an order to engage several fighters. The Army argues the individuals were not a threat, but evidence denied to Lorance’s legal team could prove differently. That same evidence may have been withheld by the chain of command for reasons that are still being examined and sure to be raised on appeal.</p><p>The case was reviewed and Lorance’s command was cleared of any wrongdoing, but there is still no explanation about why the Army refuses to produce the criminal investigation report and other information. Perhaps Lorance was not the best soldier, which may in fact be true, but is he a murderer who deserves nearly two decades in prison? Unlikely.</p><p>Another incident involves a soldier who received the Medal of Honor, but only after a major fight. That soldier, <a href="/articles/2013/10/16/medal-of-honor-awardee-embodies-the-best-of-his-generation.html">Will Swenson</a>, found that his nomination for the top valor award was reportedly “lost” after he criticized commanders for denying him and others air support in Afghanistan out of concern for the rules of engagement, leaving them stranded. Swenson and his men fought their way out of danger, but not without taking casualties.</p><p>Swenson’s nomination was finally recovered and he received the award years after being nominated.  However, events that transpired during a period of investigation are unspeakable, giving credibility to the idea that the Army resisted the award at every turn.</p><p>In fact, Swenson’s overall experience was so bad that the Army was forced to alter its process for Medal of Honor nominations and for the Secretary of Defense to issue him a direct apology. What most people and soldiers in particular took away from the whole episode was a warning not to criticize—when permissible—the chain of command for its failures.</p><p>Again, that is no way to treat America’s military heroes.</p><p>In another incident, several severely wounded Special Forces soldiers were twice nominated for Silver Stars, the second time coming after the initial paperwork was lost. The Army had said the awards were downgraded, but years later, a mistake by a private contractor provided information on the Army’s top award recipients. Within that listing, the soldiers in question were all listed as receiving Silver Stars. The Army responded that a “typo” by the contractor might have caused the error. What they didn’t say but was discovered sometime later was that there was an unrelated disagreement with the nominating officer.</p><p>A typo? No way. A poor excuse? More like it. All at the expense of soldiers who deserve better.</p><p>These occurrences certainly differ in their severity, but each is useful in demonstrating the pursuit of political ends to situations that begin with the battlefield actions of America’s sons and daughters who willingly and selflessly put their lives on the line. Unfortunately, there are many more incidents like these, which have only served to make servicemembers more suspicious of their leadership.</p><p>The services—and the Army, in particular—must look inward. There must be a desire to initiate a cultural shift that reassures service personnel that the institutions under which they serve won’t let them down, and they will receive the support—whether through legal, administrative or operational channels—that is worthy of their service. They want to know their best interests won’t be disregarded.</p><p>More than ten years at war and distressed budgets are sure to have an effect, but there is no denying the fact that a problem of equal size exists that’s been brought on by a propensity to question the actions and judgments of young men and women tasked with carrying out dangerous missions. With the right leadership from within, this could be the easiest change to make, and perhaps make the biggest impact. <br />

Since launching in 2011, General Assembly (or GA for short) has expanded to 13 IRL campuses worldwide that provide physical and virtual classes for the next generation of start-up talents. As head of Global Partnerships and Business Development, Brimer has set his eyes on making GA into the kind of real world, they-don’t-teach-you-this-in-college tool needed to take budding entrepreneurs to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/text4&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, a sunrise dance party and an international cutting-edge professional education concern seem like wildly disparate concepts. But to Brimer, they are cut from the same cloth, with their relative successes not the sort that can be easily charted on a spreadsheet. “I really love bringing people together and creating compelling experiences that push people in a positive direction and create serendipity,” says Brimer. “Ultimately, the greater mission is to have a positive and lasting impact on the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/text5&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/snippet&quot;,&quot;snippet&quot;:&quot; &lt;iframe src=\&quot;http://origin-snip.thedailybeast.com.s3.amazonaws.com/lenovo-recirc-1022/index.html\&quot; width=\&quot;550\&quot; height=\&quot;350\&quot; scrolling=\&quot;no\&quot; frameborder=”0” &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/snippet&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;As a freshman at Yale, Brimer first put his entrepreneurial impulses to work buying old library card catalogs from the school’s surplus and flipping them on eBay to collectors at more than 20 times the price. By his junior year, he was scoring thousands in venture capital for GoCrossCampus, a &lt;i&gt;Risk&lt;/i&gt;-like social gaming platform that, despite boasting more than 100,000 users, went belly up in 2009. “We really weren&amp;apos;t generating any revenue to speak of, which kind of is important for a business,” says Brimer with a sheepish laugh. “You know, making money.”&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/text6&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, that. Somewhat unique among his entrepreneurial brethren, the Sociology major’s instinct for start-ups and innovation comes less from making bank (though that would be nice) than bringing people together around shared passions. “I&amp;apos;ve always been fascinated by community building, by social dynamics, by how people organize and come together and associate with each other,” says Brimer.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/text7&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/pullquote&quot;,&quot;quote&quot;:&quot;“General Assembly is truly out there to change the world.”&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/pullquote_0&quot;,&quot;quoteName&quot;:&quot;pullquote_0&quot;,&quot;quotePath&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker.html&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;That was certainly the motivation behind General Assembly. “Having been through the trenches, we understood what to do, but just as importantly, what not to do,” says Brimer, who was one of the four founders of General Assembly, including his former GoCross partner Brad Hargreaves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/text8&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;“General Assembly sort of began as a social experiment or concept,” says the New-York-based Brimer. “In the very early days, we thought, ‘What if we could create a place that could bring people together, a place of entrepreneurship, collaboration, and shared learning?’ We wanted to create a place for the community to really grow and become something larger than itself. Out of that came the business and global institution that is General Assembly.”&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/text9&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Now the four-year-old company has slightly loftier goals than, say, making a few bucks off old library furniture. “General Assembly is truly out there to change the world,” says Brimer. “I&amp;apos;m not saying that in the Web 2.0, every-little-app-is-out-there-to-change-the-world [way]. I actually mean the mission of the company is about transforming people&amp;apos;s lives for the better. If you look at what we do, it&amp;apos;s about finding people with skills, and opportunities, and jobs, and communities that can help [people] pursue work that they want to pursue. That&amp;apos;s a very noble mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/text10&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;But even with GA’s initial success, Brimer’s thirst for community was hardly sated. Hence what led the passionate live music fan to co-found Daybreaker. A year in, and the social experiment-cum-dance party is now held every two weeks in New York, L.A., San Francisco, and Atlanta with plans to expand overseas later this year. A typical event might feature yoga, musicians, spoken word poets, and inspirational aphorisms amid the thumping beats. Sometimes you’ll see mascots dressed as vegetables, or a Big Glowing Jellyfish that was once a main attraction at Burning Man, or the team will bring in someone called ‘a laughing coach.’ “You never really know what you&#39;re going to get,” explains Brimer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/text11&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/text12&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;For Brimer, Daybreaker captured that social energy and community building buzz that the self-described “serial entrepreneur” had been chasing since he was a kid in St. Louis. Watching his parents start their own graphic design and architecture firms played a key part in it all. “They infused a lot of that creative and entrepreneurial in me from a very young age,” he says. “That creative spirit, that maker mentality— it&#39;s just always been in [my] blood.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/16/general-assembly-co-founder-matt-brimer-on-creating-communities-with-his-pre-work-dance-party-daybreaker/jcr:content/body/text13&quot;}],&quot;dek&quot;:&quot;Whether

The polemic comic is charged with condoning terrorism in the wake of &lt;a href=\&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/10/paris-jihadis-were-all-molotov-cocktails.html\&quot;&gt;January attacks in Paris&lt;/a&gt; that killed 17, including journalists of the satirical weekly &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/14/read-the-new-issue-of-charlie-hebdo-in-english.html\&quot;&gt;Charlie Hebdo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, three police officers, and four Jewish hostages at a kosher grocery.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text0&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Just four days after the Jan. 7 attack on &lt;i&gt;Charlie Hebdo&lt;/i&gt;, record-breaking millions marched in Paris and throughout France in the spirit of “&lt;i&gt;Je suis Charlie&lt;/i&gt;,” I am Charlie, in the name of freedom of expression and in homage to the dead. That very night, Dieudonné took to Facebook to declare, “Know that tonight, as far as I’m concerned, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly.” Recall that Amédy Coulibaly, working in league with the &lt;i&gt;Charlie Hebdo&lt;/i&gt; killers and &lt;a href=\&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/12/why-our-spies-failed-to-save-charlie-hebdo.html\&quot;&gt;claiming allegiance to Islamic State&lt;/a&gt;, shot dead a policewoman on Jan. 8, and killed four Jewish hostages in a kosher supermarket on Jan. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text1&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The comic-provocateur—notorious for his so-called “quenelle” arm gesture he deems anti-establishment but that critics liken to a Nazi salute—could face a stiff penalty if convicted. Condoning terrorism is punishable in France by up to five years in jail and a 75,000-euro fine, but doing so online can bump that up to seven years and 100,000 euros. The public prosecutor’s office asked Wednesday that Dieudonné be punished with a 30,000-euro fine, convertible to 200 days in jail should he fail to pay. A verdict is expected March 18.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text2&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;So is Dieudonné’s prosecution an ironic negation of free speech after massive Charlie Hebdo unity?

And I’m told, ‘No, no, in fact, freedom of expression is when the government decides.’ So I’m in favor of total freedom of expression.”&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text5&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;“And, above all, not two-track,” his friend Abdel Chaarir, 27, chimes in.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text6&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;“In France, you can buy a book called &lt;i&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/i&gt;,” Sofiane explains. “What I don’t understand is why Hitler isn’t censored, but they can censor an artist, a comedian.” And how does Sofiane feel when Dieudonné is called an anti-Semite? “No, it’s not possible. He’s not an anti-Semite,” he says flatly.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text7&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;In his Facebook message, Dieudonné, too, said he had marched on Jan. 11 and added sarcastically that it was “a magical moment equivalent to the Big Bang that created the universe.” The message was deleted three days later. After he was charged with condoning terrorism in January, Dieudonné’s lawyer, Sanjay Mirabeau, argued that his client associated Charlie and Coulibaly because he is made to feel like terrorist. Dieudonné repeated the sentiment in court Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text8&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;“Of course, I condemn without the slightest restraint or ambiguity the attacks,” the comic told the court, according to remarks cited by Reuters inside the courtroom. “I felt a lot of emotion that day… I feel like Charlie of course… And then at the same time I feel I am treated like a terrorist.”&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text9&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;At the moment in France, Dieudonné may not be the only one who feels this way. France’s aggressive pursuit of certain types of speech in the wake of the &lt;i&gt;Charlie Hebdo&lt;/i&gt; attacks—alongside the massive outpouring in support for free speech during the same time—has raised eyebrows. A judges’ union, a lawyers’ union, and Amnesty International quickly raised the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text10&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;In January, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told Agence France-Presse, “We must lead a debate everywhere in our society, in our neighborhoods, to explain that there is a difference between freedom of expression and criminal offenses: racism, anti-Semitism, condoning terrorism, negationism. These aren’t opinions, they are offenses punishable by law, and even more severely because we want to toughen legislation in this domain.”&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text11&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Official figures cited by AFP show 257 cases brought for condoning terrorism or inciting hatred or violence for reasons of race or religion between the attack Jan. 7 and Jan. 29. Of those, 161 cases weren’t linked to other circumstances, like drug or alcohol offenses, and 41 of those were fast-tracked to “immediate appearances” in court; 18 suspects had already been sentenced to jail time.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text12&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Last week, malaise over the tough stance on selected speech reached a fever pitch when it was revealed an 8-year-old boy had been questioned at a police station in Nice. The child, known as Ahmed, had refused to participate in his 3rd-grade class’s moment of silence for the &lt;i&gt;Charlie Hebdo&lt;/i&gt; victims, an homage held nationwide on Jan. 8. The boy reportedly said he sided with the terrorists because the victims had insulted his Prophet.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text13&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;But Dieudonné critics would point out that this latest charge isn’t exactly the comic’s first time on the playground. The controversial comedian appears to rate his own category: the serial offender with a pulpit (and, yes, lots of fans).&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text14&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;“He knows perfectly well how to play with the words, it’s his trade,” the public prosecutor’s representative said in court Wednesday. “He weighs each of his words; he knows precisely that he will be borderline,” she said, in remarks quoted by AFP inside the courtroom, adding that Dieudonné’s explanations are “always voluntarily provocative and always falsely ambiguous.”&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text15&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The comic has already been convicted nine times, most often for offenses targeting Jews—anti-Semitic speech, racist insults or inciting racial hatred. (Indeed, on Jan. 16, Dieudonné was prosecuted after launching an Internet campaign for donations to pay off his previous fines.)&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text16&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The Charlie Coulibaly case is at least the third allegation against him for condoning terrorism, although he has yet to be convicted on that charge. He was acquitted on the charge in 2004 after saying, in the months following the Sept. 11 attacks, that, “I prefer Bin Laden’s charisma to that of George Bush.” Last fall, French authorities opened an investigation into remarks he made about ISIS’s decapitation of American journalist James Foley.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text17&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Dieudonné is no stranger to the Paris courthouse’s docket. In the last three weeks alone, he has been named in five other cases on the agenda here. Only 24 hours before Wednesday’s appearance, he was on the hook for insults stemming from an August 2013 video in which he called Prime Minister Valls, who was then Interior Minister, “Mussolini halfway suffering from Down’s Syndrome” and “a spineless and docile little Israeli soldier.” Valls has asked for a symbolic euro in damages, while the Public Prosecutor’s office has called for a 4,000-euro fine; Dieudonné’s lawyer, meanwhile, wants 15,000 euros in damages for abuse of process. A verdict is expected March 24.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text18&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;And just a week ago, Dieudonné was prosecuted here for inciting racial hatred. In 2013, footage from one of his comedy shows depicted him saying of a French radio journalist, “When I hear him speak, Patrick Cohen, I say to myself, you see, the gas chambers… too bad…” At the time, the comments sparked outrage at the highest echelons. Valls obtained bans on Dieudonné’s performances in France. During last week’s trial, the Public Prosecutor’s office requested another 30,000-euro fine (convertible into 300 days in jail if Dieudonné doesn’t pay up). There, too, a decision is pending, on March 19.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/04/french-comic-dieudonne-on-trial-for-charlie-hebdo-messages/jcr:content/body/text19&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Just

My mom was a Realtor when I was a kid. I ended up in the technology industry, though, and I started another company in the travel space called Hotwire. I sold that to Expedia, which is how I met Stan, who was running analytics at Expedia at the time. Then, in 2005, the management team from Expedia essentially left together to go and start Zillow. We started Zillow at that time because it seemed like one of the last categories of the Internet that hadn’t been impacted by the Internet revolution and by consumer empowerment. There were all these other verticals that had had a wave of consumer empowerment through access to data, but real estate was one of the last. So we took our revolutionary zeal to the real estate industry and opened up databases that were previously locked to consumers. That’s what Zillow was all about.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text4&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SH&lt;/strong&gt;: Real estate’s always had a personal interest for me because I’ve ended up across my life to date moving quite often, so I’ve been in a lot of different renting and owning situations. You kind of get into real estate and learn what works and doesn’t by doing a lot of these transactions. But I would say my real passion in real estate since being at Zillow is from the data side. Real estate is this space that is really interesting to me because it is swimming in data, but people have not really done very much with that data until recently. That creates real opportunities for businesses like Zillow, where you’ve got a lot of data and a lot of runway to do a lot of interesting things. Typically you have industries where you don’t have a lot of data, and people don’t do a lot with it, or you have a lot of data and people have already done a lot with it. Think equity markets for ones that have a lot of data and people do a lot with it, and labor markets as being one where there is not as much data and therefore people haven’t done as many interesting things with it. But real estate is one where you have a lot of data. People just hadn’t done a lot with it.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text5&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/pullquote&quot;,&quot;quote&quot;:&quot;The myth is that it’s best to do the kitchen remodel as best way to add value to your house, but it’s the bathroom remodel that gives you the most money back.&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/pullquote&quot;,&quot;quoteName&quot;:&quot;pullquote&quot;,&quot;quotePath&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks.html&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So in Chapter 3, you kind of say, “Forget hipsters. There is a better way to figure out if a neighborhood is going to be gentrified.” What is the best way?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text6&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SH&lt;/strong&gt;: That chapter was really about looking at a few different ways that are helpful for identifying the next hot neighborhood. One of the more intriguing things that we were able to show empirically there was what we call the halo effect, which is instead of focusing on location, location, location, you really want to focus on future location, future location, future location. As we said in the chapter, instead of moving to where the cool is, wait for the cool to come for you. The way to do that is to look at neighborhoods that are adjacent to the current hot areas, because over time they become hot in their own right. So there are good values if you can identify them now and wait for home values to rise in the future. We looked at neighborhoods that were more likely to undergo gentrification and the factor we found to be highly predictive was neighborhoods that have older homes in them with low home-ownership rates but are nearby to popular neighborhoods—and that may not be nearby in terms of walking, but nearby in terms of transit routes. Because if you think about what’s happened in Brooklyn, where those weren’t close to neighborhoods in Manhattan, but they were one rail stop away. Nobody was going to swim across the river to them—but they were on a rail access line, which made them very accessible, so they became gentrification targets.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text7&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The book isn’t just about when or how you should buy or sell a house, but &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; you should even consider. What are some things people should consider?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text8&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SR&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;We wrote the book to try to debunk myths and replace fiction with fact. One of the most common pieces of conventional wisdom in the real estate space is that you should always buy a home instead of rent. The data proves unequivocally that that’s not correct, that sometimes it’s more appropriate for people to rent than to buy. We analyze in the book what circumstances specify when one should rent instead of buy. The simple way to understand when to rent is to evaluate how long you are going to live in that property. I think people understand fundamentally that if you’re going to stay in a home for 30 years you should buy it, or for six months you should probably rent it. What we’ve done in the book is we’ve figured out by city when that crossover point is when you should switch from renting to buying. For instance, in New York the crossover point is five years. In other words, if you’re going to be in a home for less than five years you should probably rent, if longer, you should probably buy. But other parts of the country, like Detroit, the breakeven is about one year. So if you’re going to be in the home for a year, you would be better off buying it, not renting it.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text9&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A lot of the book is about taking on these myths—location, location, location; the worst house on the best street; and so on. Which myth is the most damaging and why?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text10&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SH&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Probably the housing finance one since that’s where a lot of people spend more money than they should and generally over-rely on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages as opposed to utilizing an adjustable-rate mortgage. I think that’s at no time more true than after the recession, when adjustable-rate mortgages got a lot of the rap for what happened during the recession. Spencer and I, in the chapter, we talk about how we’ve got six mortgages between the two of us and because of the timing, we’ve been younger in our home-buying activity so we’ve always gotten adjusted-rate mortgages. Oftentimes I think I’m concerned when people get a 30-year-fixed rate mortgages and stay there for four years. Essentially each of those four years they’re overpaying on their mortgage—they’re paying an extra amount each month in order to have the right to stay there for 30 years if they wanted to, even though they have no intention of staying there for 30 years. So it’s buying that right to stay there for 30 years which gets really expensive. I think many people just do it reflexively as opposed to thinking about the mortgage product that fits their circumstances the best.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text11&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I think you call it the men’s trousers of real estate?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text12&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SH&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, that’s right, an unexamined assumption everyone makes, but it’s not clear why everyone does that.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text13&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SR&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an interesting one because the housing downturn swung the pendulum too far in the wrong direction. We threw the baby out with the bathwater when pundits decided after the housing downturn that the reason we had the bubble was because too many people had adjustable-rate mortgages. Stan and I are arguing that a more circumspect evaluation is in order. For a lot of people, an adjustable-rate mortgage is a great way to finance a purchase of a home. Again, it depends on how long you’re going to be in the property. If you’re going to be there for less than seven years, you should absolutely consider an adjustable-rate mortgage. If you got a 30-year fix for that five-year period, you’re going to pay a lot more per month to live in the same exact home, and the reason is that you’re basically buying an option for the right to stay in that home for 30 years. But if you know you’re going to be there less than seven, you could pay a lot less on that home with an adjustable-rate mortgage. It’s very shortsighted to just dismiss a whole class of mortgage finance because of the way the media reported on the downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text14&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Home improvement is obviously a big part of American homeownership—and is &lt;a href=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boI4D1FlIVs\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;ripe for spoof&lt;/a&gt; as people love/hate it. What should people keep in mind?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text15&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SH&lt;/strong&gt;: We loved working on this chapter about the remodels. This is an area where there are all these hunches about what the best remodel is to do, and there are all these studies that are just based on surveys where they ask contractors what they think, but there was no empirical data to unravel any of this. So we were excited about doing this work. We were actually able to take thousands of remodels that people had told us about on Zillow, and over the nine years we’ve been in business, see those homes subsequently resell again, and then tease out the impact of that remodel on the sale price, controlling for a bunch of other stuff. The myth is that it’s best to do the kitchen remodel as best way to add value to your house, but we actually crunched the numbers and it’s the bathroom remodel that gives you the most money back. It’s a triumph of function over fashion. That everyone can use more working toilets, particularly when you have guests in town, but the tile color in your new kitchen may not necessarily be something the buyer will want.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text16&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everyone reading this should be doing a jig if they live on a street named Lake or Sunset.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text17&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SH&lt;/strong&gt;: Well Lake and Sunset are the two highest names, but generally anybody living on a name street instead of a number street should be happy because names have higher value than number, and Lake and Sunset kind of top that out. The reason they do so is that not only they are names but because they are naming a geographic feature that is associated with high value as well, namely being on a lake or having a good view of the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text18&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I was curious to get your take on the future of crowdfunding in real estate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text19&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SR&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve actually looked at it a lot through my involvement in Tech Stars, which is a start-up incubator. I’ve actually helped some of these companies get started. One of them, Realty Mogul, has had pretty good success. I’ve been an informal adviser to them, and one of our directors, Gordon Stephenson, is an investor in Realty Mogul. I think it’s a really interesting idea as a way to tap new access to capital. I’m really worried about the cyclicality of it. The promise that crowdfunding provides is for a doctor or lawyer who wants to put part of her nest egg in residential or commercial real estate—it’s very difficult to do so because it’s illiquid and complicated—so if I could just put a couple thousand dollars at a time into these different projects, it might create a new asset class. The problem that I foresee with real estate crowdfunding is as soon as there is any kind of downturn at all, that kind of capital dries up really quickly, and these companies will have a hard time sustaining themselves. I’m cautious on the sector for that reason, even though some of them, like Realty Mogul, seem to be having success so far.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text20&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So in the book you write that you think the real estate agent is here to stay. Why do you think so?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text21&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SR&lt;/strong&gt;: This is still an incredibly infrequent, emotional, and complex transaction. Most consumers will still seek the expert advice of a real estate agent. I think it’s somewhat akin to health care, where when you get sick you take your health care into your own hands, you research it on the web, you use your tablet, your smartphone, use Yahoo Health, use Wikipedia, WebMD to learn about your diseases—but you still go to the doctor. And the doctor helps you interpret all the crazy stuff on the Internet. It’s very similar in real estate. I think consumers have taken power into their own hands and are using services like Zillow to get lots of information. But then they’re still going to a professional to help them interpret it. Now, the role of the real estate agent, like the role of the doctor, has changed dramatically because of the Internet. It used to be that the real estate agent was just an information gatekeeper, somebody that had access to the secret database and provided that access to the consumer. No more. Now the consumer has access to the same information, and the role of the professional is to interpret it, to be a transaction consultant, to be a local expert, and to coach them through this complicated and infrequent transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text22&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your formula, the Zestimate, is an important part of the market, maybe even market-making. Do you worry about the responsibility that comes with such an influential perch over such an important part of the economy?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text23&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SH&lt;/strong&gt;: I think we focus a lot on accuracy, because that’s what consumers care about. We are committed to always improving our models, and if you look at our history in terms of accuracy, you can see that right now we’ve got about 8 percent meeting absolute error, whereas when we launched back in 2006 we were about 14 percent. So we’ve gotten substantially more accurate in the models than when we launched. We care a lot about accuracy. I wouldn’t frame the question in terms of responsibility, of implying that the Zestimate can move the market, and I guess I would probably take issue with that characterization because what we find is that we have about half the sales that are above the Zestimate and about half that are below. I believe if we had a substantial influence in driving the markets we would find that no one would be willing to pay more than the Zestimate for a home. In fact, we don’t find that at all. I think it’s a really useful starting point for homeowners in terms of value. People who are buying and selling, they’re out in the market, they’re looking at these homes, several every day. They’ve got a lot of data points, and the idea that they’re not going to pay more than the Zestimate on a home, if they’re a buyer, or they’re not going to take less than the Zestimate if they’re a seller, I don’t think is borne out in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text24&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It would appear, at least from the book, that you both travel a lot. Is there a place in the U.S. where you think particularly interesting things are happening in real estate?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text25&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SH&lt;/strong&gt;: I’d probably give you a city pair. The pairing that is most interesting to me right now is probably Dallas versus San Francisco. Right now at Zillow on the econ side, we’re very focused on affordable rental housing and talking about how affordable rental housing is at crisis proportions in the U.S. So I’m interested in why places like Dallas have such an easier time producing affordable rental housing than places like San Francisco. We think it probably has a lot to do with local regulations. A place like Houston has almost no zoning and very light building codes, whereas kind of the opposite is true in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text26&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you hope people who pick up this book take away from it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text27&quot;},{&quot;resourceType&quot;:&quot;dailybeast2/components/text&quot;,&quot;textIsRich&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SH&lt;/strong&gt;: We started with a list of 50 topics and myths that we thought were going to be interesting and boiled it down into what’s in the book now. In the selection of that we tried to find stuff from high policy-type chapters to insightful, practical tips for homeowners, buyers, sellers, or renters, to really fun interesting tidbits like the Lake versus Sunset part we talked about before. So we think there’s something for everybody. Our intent in writing the book was trying to move real estate, which has been a sector rife with myths and old advice and hunches. We wanted to move people’s thinking to fact. From folklore to fact that has actual data underneath. If anything, people reading this come away from it thinking, “There’s probably some data on this that I should go find to see if it’s true or not.” People would be better consumers if they thought that way.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/31/zillow-s-secret-real-estate-hacks/jcr:content/body/text28&quot;}],&quot;dek&quot;:&quot;Remodeling the bathroom, not the kitchen, gives you the most bang for your buck.
